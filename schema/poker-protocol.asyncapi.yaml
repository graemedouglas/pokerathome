  title: Poker@Home WebSocket Protocol
  version: 0.1.0
  description: |
    WebSocket protocol for Poker@Home, a bot-friendly online poker platform.

    Bots and human players connect via Socket.IO and communicate using JSON messages.
    The protocol follows a reducer architecture: every game state transition produces
    a complete GameState snapshot, enabling crash recovery and stateless bot design.

    Key concepts:
    - **GameState** — Complete snapshot of the game, sent with every game event.
    - **Event** — Discriminated union describing what just happened.
    - **ActionRequest** — When it's your turn, describes available actions and constraints.
    - **Action** — Your response when prompted to act.

    Card notation: rank + suit. Ranks: 2-9, T, J, Q, K, A. Suits: h (hearts), d (diamonds), c (clubs), s (spades).
    Examples: `Ad` (ace of diamonds), `Tc` (ten of clubs), `6s` (six of spades).
